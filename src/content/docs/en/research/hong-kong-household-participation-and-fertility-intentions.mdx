### [Study: Couples’ housework participation, housework satisfaction and fertility intentions among married couples in Hong Kong](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17441730.2023.2252633)

* **Persistent Low Fertility:** East Asian societies, notably Hong Kong, have experienced sustained low total fertility rates (TFR), raising concerns about population aging and labor force declines.
* **Gender Inequality at Home:** A significant barrier to women achieving their desired fertility, impacting societal and economic dynamics.
* **Focus of Study:** Examines the intricate relationship between couples’ housework participation, satisfaction, and fertility intentions in Hong Kong.

### **Why it Matters**

* **Demographic Challenges:** Low fertility rates pose long-term challenges for economic growth and social stability.
* **Gender Equity Theory:** The study lends support to this theory, suggesting that unequal domestic burdens contribute to low fertility rates.

### **In-depth Background**

* **TFR Trends in Hong Kong:** The TFR fell below 1 in the early 2000s, recovered slightly, and then declined again in 2020.
* **Traditional Values:** Despite low TFR, ideal fertility rates remain higher, indicating unmet fertility desires.
* **Research Gaps:** Previous studies have not adequately explored the indirect relationship between housework and fertility, nor the conditions under which this relationship varies.

### **Study's Core Propositions**

* **Hypotheses Testing:** Two sets of hypotheses focus on the relationship between housework arrangements, satisfaction, and fertility intentions.
* **Conceptual Framework:** Integrates gender equity theory and distributive justice perspective from housework literature.

### **Methodology**

* **Data Collection:** A representative household survey was conducted in Hong Kong, targeting married adults.
* **Sampling Strategy:** Multistage sampling with stratification across Hong Kong districts.
* **Analytical Approach:** Regression and logistic regression models, examining variables like housework time, satisfaction, fertility intentions, and gender role attitudes.

### **Key Findings**

1. **Gender Differences in Housework:** Women report significantly more housework time than men.
2. **Housework Satisfaction:** Women’s satisfaction is negatively impacted by their housework time; spousal contribution positively influences satisfaction.
3. **Gender Role Attitudes:** Act as moderators in the relationship between housework participation and satisfaction.
4. **Fertility Intentions:** Positively associated with housework satisfaction, particularly among women.

### **Detailed Results**

* **Regression Analyses:** Reveal intricate dynamics between housework time, satisfaction, and fertility intentions.
* **Gender Specifics:** Different patterns were observed for male and female respondents in terms of satisfaction and fertility intentions.

### **Limitations and Concerns**

* **Causality Issues:** Due to the cross-sectional nature of the data, the study cannot establish causation definitively.
* **Self-Report Accuracy:** Potential over-reporting in time-use data, especially among men.

### **Implications for Policy and Future Research**

* **Policy Recommendations:** Advocating for gender equality at home and promoting paternal involvement in domestic labor.
* **Future Research Needs:** Longitudinal studies and more reliable time-use data (e.g., diaries) to deepen understanding.

### **Bottomline**

This comprehensive study elucidates the complex interplay between housework dynamics and fertility intentions in East Asia, particularly Hong Kong. It highlights the need for a societal shift towards greater gender equity in domestic responsibilities as a potential avenue to address the persistent low fertility rates. The findings have profound implications for policy-making and future research, urging a reevaluation of traditional gender roles and their impact on demographic trends.
