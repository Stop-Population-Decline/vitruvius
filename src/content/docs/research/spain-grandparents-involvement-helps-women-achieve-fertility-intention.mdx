### [Study: Do I want more if you help me? The impact of grandparental involvement on men’s and women’s fertility intentions](https://genus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41118-022-00161-x)

* **Background**: Over the last four decades, advanced societies have witnessed a notable decline in fertility rates. This trend initially coincided with women's evolving roles in society, but various factors, including state policies and familial support systems, have since shaped these trends.
* **Focus of Study**: This study delves into the impact of grandparental support on fertility intentions, particularly in Spain, a country characterized by late motherhood and weak family policies.

### **Why It Matters**:

* **Social Planning**: Understanding fertility trends is vital for demographic planning and social policy development.
* **Intergenerational Support**: Insights into the role of grandparents in fertility decisions can help frame policies that support family life balance.
* **Gender-Specific Impacts**: Recognizing how fertility intentions differ between men and women can lead to more targeted and effective policies.

### Core Findings

1. **Grandparental Support and Women's Fertility**:
   * **General Trend**: Grandparental support has a significant positive impact on the fertility intentions of women, more so than men.
   * **High-Educated Women**: This group shows a particularly strong response to grandparental support, likely due to higher work-family conflicts.
   * **Spain's Unique Context**: The impact of grandparental support is especially pronounced in Spain, reflecting the country's familialistic values and weak public family policies.
2. **Socio-Economic Influences**:
   * **Education and Employment**: Fertility intentions are influenced by women's education level and employment status, with highly educated women showing higher responsiveness to grandparental support.
   * **Income Levels**: Household income also plays a role, although its impact is less pronounced compared to education and employment.
3. **The Spanish Fertility Landscape**:
   * **Low Fertility Rates**: Spain's fertility rates are among Europe's lowest, with a significant gap between desired and actual fertility.
   * **Labor Market Dynamics**: Women in Spain face a notable motherhood penalty, impacting career trajectories and earnings.
   * **Cultural Factors**: Strong familial ties and reliance on grandparental support are characteristic of the Spanish context.

### In-Depth Analysis

* **Gender Differences in Perceived Parenthood Costs**:
  * **Women's Perspective**: Women, particularly after childbirth, bear the brunt of housework and childcare, affecting their career development and independence.
  * **Men's Perspective**: Men tend to perceive parenthood as enhancing their partnership quality, with less impact on career trajectories.
* **Grandparental Support in Spanish Society**:
  * **Relevance in Spain**: In Spain, grandparental support is not just practical aid but a reflection of cultural values and familial ties.
  * **Impact on Fertility Intentions**: Grandparental childcare provision is seen as a crucial factor in increasing women's labor force participation and fertility intentions, particularly for high-educated women.
* **Role of Grandparental Support Across Parities**:
  * **Second Child Transition**: Grandparental support significantly influences the intention to have a second child, aligning with the average desired family size in Spain.
  * **Beyond Second Child**: The influence of grandparental support diminishes the intention to have a third or subsequent child.

### Policy Implications and Recommendations

* **Supportive Family Policies**: There's a need for policies that acknowledge and enhance the role of grandparental support in fertility decisions.
* **Work-Life Balance**: Creating more family-friendly work environments, particularly for highly educated women, can help bridge the fertility gap.
* **Childcare Options**: Improving access to affordable childcare and promoting flexible work arrangements can support families in balancing work and family life.

### Future Research Directions

* **Longitudinal Studies**: Further research using longitudinal data can help understand how fertility intentions translate into actual behaviors.
* **Comparative Studies**: Examining different countries can provide insights into how cultural, economic, and policy contexts influence the role of grandparental support.
* **Gender Dynamics in Fertility Decisions**: Investigating the negotiation and decision-making processes within couples regarding fertility can offer deeper insights into gender-specific fertility behaviors.

### Conclusion

**Key Takeaway**: This study underscores the significant impact of grandparental support on fertility intentions, particularly for women and more so in contexts with weaker family policies like Spain.

**Broader Perspective**: The findings highlight the need for comprehensive family support systems that consider the multifaceted influences on fertility, from gender dynamics and socio-economic factors to cultural norms and state policies.

**Final Thought**: Addressing the fertility gap in advanced societies requires a nuanced understanding of the interplay between family dynamics, state policies, and societal values. Grandparental support emerges as a pivotal element in this equation, shaping the future of family planning and demographic trends.
