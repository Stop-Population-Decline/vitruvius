### [Study: Beyond the Great Recession: Labor Market Polarization and Ongoing Fertility Decline in the United States ](https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/56/4/1463/168042/Beyond-the-Great-Recession-Labor-Market)

The U.S. Great Recession (2007-2009) was more than an economic crisis. It spurred a lasting shift in fertility trends, leading to historically low birth rates. This study delves into the persisting decline in fertility rates, despite post-recession improvements in unemployment rates and median household income. The focus is on deep structural changes in the labor market and their implications.

### **Backdrop**

* **Economic Impact of the Great Recession:** The recession saw the U.S. losing 8.8 million jobs, with the unemployment rate peaking at 9.5%. The economic turmoil wiped out approximately $19.2 trillion in U.S. household wealth.
* **Post-Recession Fertility Trends:** Contrary to expectations of recovery post-recession, fertility rates have continually plummeted, reaching record lows.

### **Key Findings**

* **Structural Changes in Labor Markets:** A major finding is a shift from goods-producing to service sectors, termed "labor market polarization." This has extended financial uncertainty, profoundly influencing decisions around childbearing.
* **Racial and Ethnic Impacts:** The study highlights that the decline in goods-producing industries disproportionately affects Hispanic and Black communities compared to White and Asian populations.
* **Local Variation in Economic Conditions:** The study underscores the importance of examining local, metropolitan-level labor markets. These areas show significant variation in economic conditions and job opportunities within states, impacting fertility trends.

### **In-Depth Analysis**

* **Data and Methodology:** Utilizing a combination of statistical data, survey information, and vital registration records, the study analyzes trends from the early 1990s to the present, with a focus on 2006-2014.
* **Key Observations:** It notes a decline in middle-skill, middle-income jobs and an increase in low- and high-skill service sector positions.
* **Driving Factors:** Structural changes in labor markets, rather than just cyclical economic conditions, are identified as key drivers in the declining fertility rates.

#### **Detailed Insights**

* **Ongoing Shifts in Labor Market Composition:** The study proposes that ongoing shifts in the U.S. labor market composition are causing prolonged financial uncertainty, affecting decisions about childbearing.
* **Challenge to Prevailing Views:** It challenges the traditional view that fertility rates are primarily influenced by short-term economic cycles.

**Racial and Ethnic Implications**

* **Disproportionate Impact on Hispanic Fertility:** Hispanic fertility is substantially more responsive to the loss of goods-producing businesses.
* **Historical Inequalities and Labor Market Stratification:** The study underscores how historical inequalities and labor market stratification have led to distinct fertility responses among different racial and ethnic groups during economic downturns.

**Local Geographic Focus**

* **Importance of Local Areas:** Emphasizing local geographic areas, specifically metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), the study points to significant variation in economic conditions and job opportunities within states.
* **Influence of Social Networks:** The importance of local social networks in shaping family and fertility decision-making is highlighted.

### **Bottomline**

* **Structural Factors Versus Cyclical Fluctuations:** The study concludes that structural economic factors, particularly labor market polarization, have a more substantial impact on declining fertility rates than short-term unemployment fluctuations.
* **Broader Implications for Demographic Research:** These findings highlight the need for demographic research to consider long-term economic processes when understanding U.S. fertility trends.

**Further Considerations**

* **Long-Term Structural Changes:** The study discusses the implications of long-term structural changes in U.S. labor markets since the 1980s. The gradual disappearance of middle-skill, middle-income jobs and the rise of service sector positions have reshaped the economic opportunities available to workers, especially those without a college degree.
* **Differential Impact Across Age Groups:** The study also explores how these changes have differently impacted various age groups in terms of fertility. Notably, younger women seem to be delaying childbirth more significantly than older women.
* **Policy Implications:** The findings suggest that addressing declining fertility rates may require more than short-term economic fixes. Policymakers may need to consider structural labor market reforms and support systems that address the deeper causes of financial uncertainty and its impact on family planning.

**Looking Ahead:**

* **Future Research Directions:** The study opens up avenues for future research, particularly in understanding individual-level decisions in the context of broader economic trends. It also calls for a focus on nonmetropolitan and rural areas, which have also experienced significant declines in goods-producing industries.
* **Societal Implications:** Understanding these fertility trends is crucial, as they have profound implications for social policies, economic planning, and the future demographic landscape of the U.S.
